            <p>
                To give a background myself, I was born in a military base in Fort Campbell, KY/TN. The majority of
                my life, I grew up in the surburbs of Lavergne, Tennessee. My passion with technology started at the
                young age of five, using different models of computer. At a young age, I had natural hands on
                approach to using technology and knew this was something I could do in the future. I moved to New
                Jersey in 2010, and currently still reside here. My love and passion with technology would start to
                become more of an obsession
            <p>
                During my time in high school, I had the privilege of working for North Brunswick Summer Enrichment Program
                as a Teacher's Aide in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as training and
                development, special-needs instruction, and peer counseling. In both my academic and professional life,
                I have been consistently praised as proactive by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic,
                extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven leadership, teamwork, and communication skills,
                which I hope to leverage as an Intern at your company. I have an outstanding passion with technology and
                continue to improve my technical knowledge to better myself as an individual I have a great amount of
                ambition to accomplish my future career goals and will provide the upmost dedication to the job at hand
            </p>

            <p>I have a great tradition of military service, with my father serving for 20 years, and for myself, joining
                in the fray to continue the tradition Cyber security is all I ever want to in terms of my future. Individuals
                in cyber security, information systems, computer science, Information technology, etc fields have to be
                technologically advanced, quick-witted, and able to solve complex problems. You need strong leaders in the
                tech sector, and I believe I can provide my own skills and knowledge to contribute as much as possible to
                achieve anything
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven leadership,
                teamwork, and communication skills, which I hope to leverage into a future career in tech and business.
                Due to my background, I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly
                and perform above expectations. I am the type that is competent and competitive candidate that these
                jobs are looking for
            </p>
